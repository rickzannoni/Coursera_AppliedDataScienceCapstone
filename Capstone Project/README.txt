# BUSINESS CASE: SUSHI RESTAURANT IN MILAN

Welcome to this business case, which is the final project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certification!

The notebook in this repository contains the suggested solution to the problem of identifying the best neighborhood in Milan to open a Sushi Restaurant
Please, have a look at the report for further details about the problem and the suggested solution.

Of course, this business case had to follow some specific requirements sey by IBM Capstone Project (in eaxmple using Foursquare API etc.) and the solution represent a proxy of a far more complex problem.
